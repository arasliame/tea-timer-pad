NodeMCU

Documenting how I have it wired up because I guarantee that I will forget

From the NodeMCU:
3v3 to breadboard +
gnd to breabboard -
D7 to LED Matrix CLK
D6 to LED Matrix CS
D5 to LED Matrix DIN
D2 to passive buzzer
D0 to pressure pad & 1K resistor into -
A0 to potentiometer

From the Potentiometer:
Data to A0
Other pins to + and -

From the pressure pad:
One side to D0 and 1K resistor into -
One side to +

From the LED Matrix:
See NodeMCU, ground and power are normal

From the buzzer:
One pin to D2, other to ground
